# Driver-Passenger-Optimiser

This repository contains Python code that optimises the assignment of drivers to passengers for ridesharing, considering distance minimisation and car capacity constraints. It uses the OR-Tools library for linear optimisation and the Geopy library for distance calculations between suburbs.
